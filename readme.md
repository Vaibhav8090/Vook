### Features
- No need to carry a whole bundle of books 
- Easy workflow management
- Work is never lost, every data is secure 
### Its Principle
A simple concept is when we learn something by writing (or by taking notes) it takes a
lot of time and do not lasts long so when we came back to revise we get a lot of doubt
(because while taking notes, we can't write everything that the lecturer or the faculty
says) whereas,
With the help of V Notes(one of the features of V BOOK), we can get through it as in V
Notes we can add audio files and also record some parts of complicated lecture so
when we revise it by listening and watching the concepts got much clear and lasts
longer also it saves a lot of time.
